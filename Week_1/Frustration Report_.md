### **Frustration Report:**

### **1\. Challenges Faced**

#### **Difficulties in Dataset Selection**

* The World Development Indicators (WDI), the Doing Business Database, and the Global Financial Development Database are the three datasets we have selected.  
* The hardest part was making sure that these datasets correctly showed the research goals, which had to do with business accessibility, economic policies, financial stability, credit and loans, taxes, and trade across borders.  
* It took work to figure out how the datasets were structured and what their variables meant, especially when it came to matching country-specific measures with business conditions.


#### **Difficulties in Understanding Dataset Structure**

* Entity-Relationship (ER) Model was created to easily organize and combine data, but it needed careful mapping of attributes like country codes, indicator codes, and time-series data.  
* Structuring links while keeping things clear was hard when making the ER Diagram and Description.  
* In-depth studies of countries and their factors were also needed for the schema design for certain databases.


### **2\. Difficulties in Formulating Research Questions**

* The Entity-Relationship (ER) Model was made to make it easy to organize and join data, but attributes like country codes, indicator codes, and time-series data had to be carefully mapped.  
* It was hard to structure the links in the ER Diagram and Description while still making things clear.  
* A lot of research had to be done on countries and the things that affect them in order to build the schema for some databases.  
    
  


### **3\. Strategies Used to Overcome Obstacles**

* **Peer Discussions and Collaboration:** We worked together to clear up any questions and split up the work, making sure that the datasets and indicators fit together well.  
* **Iterative Refinement:** We started by making a list of 30 indicators from each dataset and then ranked them by how important they were.  
* **Using the ER Model and Schema:** This helped organize the data well, which made it easy to match it up with research questions.  
* **Resolving Schema & Data Structuring Issues**: The files had different data structures, which made combining them hard. To connect financial and economic data, we made an Entity-Relationship (ER) Model and set up the schema with primary and foreign keys

### **4\. Reflections and Lessons Learned**

* **What You Would Do Differently**  
  * We learned that research is an ongoing process that needs to be improved over time: research questions, dataset structure, and filtering criteria all need to be fine-tuned in order to gain useful insights.  
  * To make the process go more smoothly, we should start with a clear research objective.   
      
* **How This Experience Shaped Your Research Approach**  
  * This helped us in Learning more about how to organize a study project that uses a lot of data sets.  
  * Learned how important it is to create schemas and data relationships so that data can be retrieved quickly.  
  * Understand why it's important to make changes and try again when coming up with study questions.  
  * Putting together a SQL-related database from a noSQL database  
  * Combining jobs into smaller, more manageable steps helped us cut down on waste and concentrate on making decisions based on data.
